# Green Energy Stock Analysis 


## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this project was to refactor a previously written code to run faster and more efficiently while maintaining the same functionality.  The given code was written in VBA for an Excel spreadsheet containing green energy stock daily trading information. The original code's purpose was to loop through the data, find the total daily volume for each of the twelve green energy stocks for the chosen year, calculate the return for each stock for the chosen year, and print the information in a new worksheet titled "All Stocks Analysis". An additional VBA macro was used in the original to add conditional formatting to the created table, highlighting stocks with a positive return in green, negative return in red, and converting the return value to show as a percent. The given dataset had two worksheets with green energy stock trading information, one for the year 2017 and one for the year 2018.  Each sheet had 3,013 rows of data with the ticker of the green energy stock, the date traded, the open, close, high, low, adjusted close, and volume traded for that day.
